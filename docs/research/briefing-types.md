# Codebase Documentation Briefing Types

## Overview

This document analyzes the top 10 most common questions developers have about codebases and assesses whether each can be answered solely from codebase analysis + LLM or requires external tools/knowledge.

## Analysis Framework

For each briefing type, we evaluate:
- **Codebase Only**: Can be generated purely from analyzing the code + LLM reasoning
- **External Required**: Needs information not present in the codebase (business context, deployment info, etc.)
- **Hybrid**: Best results combine codebase analysis with some external input

## Top 10 Codebase Documentation Briefing Types

### 8. Error Handling & Debugging Guide
**Question**: "How do I debug issues and handle errors?"

**Analysis**:
- **Can do from codebase**: ✅ YES
- Error handling patterns

- Debug configurations
- Common error scenarios

**Enhanced with external**:
- Production error patterns
- Monitoring setup
- Alert configurations

### 9. Deployment & DevOps Documentation
**Question**: "How is this application deployed and managed?"

**Analysis**:
- **Can do from codebase**: ❌ LIMITED
- Dockerfile/container configs
- CI/CD configuration files
- Build scripts

**Requires external**:
- Infrastructure details
- Deployment environments
- Scaling policies
- Operational procedures

---

### 10. Contributing Guidelines
**Question**: "How do I contribute code to this project?"

**Analysis**:
- **Can do from codebase**: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Code style (from linters/formatters)
- Test requirements
- Project structure conventions

**Requires external**:
- PR review process
- Team communication channels
- Release procedures
- Code ownership

## Summary Matrix

| Briefing Type | Codebase Only | External Required | Best Practice |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Architectural Overview | ✅ Yes | Business context | Start with code, add context |
| Getting Started Guide | ⚠️ Partial | Env vars, tools | Template + code analysis |
| API Documentation | ✅ Yes | Usage examples | Auto-generate + examples |
| Testing Strategy | ✅ Yes | Team practices | Code-first approach |
| Data Flow | ✅ Yes | Volume, sources | Diagram from code |
| Security Guide | ⚠️ Partial | Policies, compliance | Code + policy docs |
| Performance Guide | ⚠️ Partial | Metrics, SLAs | Static + runtime analysis |
| Error Handling | ✅ Yes | Production patterns | Code patterns suffice |
| Deployment Docs | ❌ Limited | Infrastructure | Requires external info |
| Contributing Guide | ⚠️ Partial | Team processes | Template + code style |

## Recommendations for Synthetic Training Data

### High-Value Targets (Codebase Only)
These briefing types can generate high-quality synthetic examples without external input:
1. **Architectural Overview** - Every codebase has architecture to document
2. **API Documentation** - Clear patterns, easy to validate
3. **Testing Strategy** - Patterns visible in code
4. **Error Handling Guide** - Logic is in the code

### Requires Hybrid Approach
These need minimal external input that can be templated:
1. **Getting Started Guide** - Use generic env var templates
2. **Data Flow Documentation** - Assume standard volumes
3. **Contributing Guidelines** - Use common practices

### Not Suitable for Pure Synthesis
These require too much external context:
1. **Deployment Documentation** - Too environment-specific
2. **Security Guide** - Compliance varies greatly
3. **Performance Guide** - Needs real metrics

## Implementation Strategy

For synthetic training data generation:

```python
# High-confidence briefing types
PURE_CODEBASE_BRIEFS = [
    "Create an architectural overview of this codebase",
    "Document all API endpoints and their usage",
    "Explain the testing strategy and how to write tests",
    "Document error handling patterns and debugging approaches"
]

# Hybrid briefing types (with templates)
HYBRID_BRIEFS = [
    "Write a getting started guide for new developers",
    "Document the data flow through the system",
    "Create contributing guidelines based on code patterns"
]

# Generate diverse training set
for codebase in CODEBASE_SAMPLES:
    for brief_template in PURE_CODEBASE_BRIEFS:
        # These can be fully automated
        generate_synthetic_example(brief_template, codebase)
    
    for brief_template in HYBRID_BRIEFS:
        # These need standard assumptions
        context = STANDARD_CONTEXTS[brief_template]
        generate_synthetic_example(brief_template, codebase, context)
```

This approach allows creating 7 high-quality briefing types per codebase, enabling rapid generation of diverse training data without manual intervention.
