  "brief": "# Codebase Architectural Analysis\n\n**Objective:** Analyze the provided codebase from an architect's perspective and generate a detailed architectural overview document. Focus on extracting insights directly supported by the code, rather than providing exhaustive file listings or making assumptions.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n*   Base your analysis *strictly* on the provided codebase files.\n*   If information for a required section cannot be discerned from the code, explicitly state \"Information not available in the provided codebase\" and briefly explain why (e.g., \"Deployment configuration is external\"). Do *not* invent details or make assumptions about common practices.\n*   Prioritize accuracy and evidence-based claims.\n\n## Required Analysis Areas\n\n1.  **High-Level Architecture**\n    *   Identify the primary architectural pattern(s) *demonstrably used* in the code (e.g., MVC, Client-Server, Layered, Event-Driven). Justify your identification based on code structure.\n    *   Create a Mermaid component diagram showing major system components (e.g., Frontend App, Backend API, Database) and their *observed* relationships.\n    *   Describe key design principles *evident* in the codebase (e.g., Separation of Concerns, Modularity).\n\n2.  **Component Structure**\n    *   Identify core components/modules/packages and their primary responsibilities based on the code.\n    *   Create a Mermaid class diagram for one or two *most central* classes/components, showing key properties and methods as found in the code.\n    *   Analyze dependencies between major components. Highlight any circular dependencies *found*.\n\n3.  **Data Flow**\n    *   Create a Mermaid sequence diagram illustrating a *primary* data flow (e.g., user action to data retrieval/update) as implemented in the code.\n    *   Identify key data structures/models *defined* in the code.\n    *   Document any API contracts (internal or external) *defined or consumed* within the code.\n\n4.  **State Management**\n    *   Identify how state is managed (e.g., React state, context, Redux, server-side sessions).\n    *   If complex state machines are *implemented* in the code, create a Mermaid state diagram for one.\n    *   Document any global state patterns *used* (e.g., specific libraries like Redux, context implementations).\n\n5.  **Error Handling & Resilience**\n    *   Analyze the error handling strategy *implemented* in the code.\n    *   Identify any resilience patterns (retries, circuit breakers) *explicitly present*.\n    *   Document exception hierarchies *if defined*.\n\n6.  **Security Model**\n    *   Identify authentication/authorization mechanisms *present* in the code (e.g., libraries used, middleware).\n    *   Document any encryption or data protection approaches *found*.\n    *   Highlight potential security concerns *based on the observed architecture*.\n\n7.  **Performance Considerations**\n    *   Identify caching mechanisms *implemented* (client-side or server-side).\n    *   Document concurrency/parallelism approaches *used* (e.g., async/await, worker threads).\n    *   Note any performance optimizations *visible* in the architecture/code.\n\n8.  **Testing Strategy**\n    *   Analyze the testing approach based on *test files and configurations found* (e.g., frameworks used, types of tests present).\n    *   Document test coverage *if configuration/results are available* in the codebase.\n\n9.  **Deployment Architecture**\n    *   Document the deployment model *only if discernible from code or configuration files* (e.g., Dockerfiles, build scripts targeting specific platforms).\n    *   Create a Mermaid deployment diagram *if applicable based on found configurations*.\n    *   Identify CI/CD patterns *only if configuration files* (e.g., `.github/workflows`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) are present.\n\n10. **Technology Stack**\n    *   List the key technologies, frameworks, and libraries *identified* in package managers (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`) or code imports.\n    *   Note any significant version constraints or compatibility issues *mentioned* in configurations.\n    *   Identify any clearly deprecated or outdated dependencies *based on package information*.\n\n## Mermaid Diagram Requirements\n1. Basic rules:\n   - Use square brackets `[]` for node names (e.g. `[Component]` not `{Component}`)\n   - Keep names simple - no special characters or parentheses\n   - Use `-->` for arrows\n   - Validate at: https://mermaid.live\n\n2. STRICT limitations:\n   - Max 10 nodes per diagram\n   - Only these diagram types:\n     - Simple flowcharts (`graph TD`/`graph LR`)\n     - Basic class diagrams (`classDiagram`)\n   - NEVER use:\n     - Subgraphs\n     - Sequence diagrams\n     - Complex styling\n\nExample valid diagrams:\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Core[Core] --> Adapter[Adapter]\n    Adapter --> HTTP[HTTP]\n```\n\n```mermaid  \nclassDiagram\n    class Axios {\n        +request()\n    }\n    Axios --> Adapter\n```\n\n## Output Format Guidelines\n\n-   Begin with an executive summary (max 3 paragraphs) summarizing key findings.\n-   Use Mermaid diagrams (at least 3 relevant diagrams based on findings) to visualize architecture.\n-   Include a \"Key Architectural Decisions\" section highlighting important design choices *observed*.\n-   End with a \"Recommendations\" section for potential architectural improvements *based on the analysis*.\n-   Use markdown formatting for readability.\n",
