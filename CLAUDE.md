# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an experimental project aimed at recreating a tech writer agent using DSPY. The project is in its initial stages with basic Python project structure set up.

## Development Setup

### Python Version
- This project requires Python 3.12 (specified in `.python-version`)
- Use pyenv or similar tool to ensure correct Python version

### Project Configuration
- Uses `pyproject.toml` for project configuration
- Currently no dependencies are specified - DSPY and other requirements will need to be added

## Common Commands

Since this is an early-stage project, common development commands are not yet established. As the project develops, you will need to:

1. Add dependencies (including DSPY) to `pyproject.toml`
2. Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Implement the tech writer agent functionality
4. Add test framework and testing commands
5. Add linting/formatting tools as needed

## Code Architecture

Currently minimal - the project consists of:
- `hello.py`: A simple placeholder script
- `pyproject.toml`: Basic Python project configuration
- Standard repository files (README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore)

The architecture will evolve as the DSPY-based tech writer agent is implemented.
